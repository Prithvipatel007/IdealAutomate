                                <Bold>Create New C# WPF Projects with single click</Bold> - IdealAutomate Explorer has a File/New Project menu tool item. Use File/New Project to easily create a C# WPF Application with a reference to IdealAutomateCore library. The IdealAutomateCore library allows one to automate almost any task. It does this by making it possible for you to write applications that can find images on the screen. By finding an image on the screen, you are able to locate where you want to read or write something, regardless of which application the image resides within. The fact that you can read and write to virtually any location makes it possible to create a degree of artificial intelligence where the application is able to perform real-time, problem-solving activities. For example, the application can read a piece of information, interpret what it has read, and then make decisions in real time about what to do based on that interpretation.

Manual Execution Time is used to enter how long in seconds that it takes you to do some process manually. Manual Execution Time is compared to Actual Execution Time when you have executables that automate some process to tell you how much time is saved by using the automated process. The Custom Field and Status metadata are particularly useful when you have a folder of files that represent a todo list. Hotkeys make it so that you can execute any program by pressing the hotkey for that program while IdealAutomate Explorer is running..
