# IdealAutomate
Here are several C# WPF applications related to automating redundant tasks.
The main project is IdealAutomateExplorer.  Ideal Automate Explorer is very similar to Windows Explorer, except Ideal Automate Explorer allows you to have multiple tabs so that you can have several different folders at your fingertips all at once. One way to use Ideal Automate Explorer is as a repository for a knowledge base because it allows you to easily group together documents, images, and links that are related to each other in some way. However, the primary purpose of Ideal Automate Explorer is that it gives you an easy way to modify and execute any C# WPF projects that you have written to automate redundant tasks.      <br/><br/>

 Another key project is called Ideal Automate Core. The Ideal Automate Core library makes it easy to write C# WPF  projects to automate tasks because it includes common methods that are needed to read information from your computer screen and have your computer respond by typing or using the mouse. IdealAutomateCore is a class library that contains most of the methods that are commonly used to automate any task on the computer. For example, there are methods that allow you to easily do the following things: <br/><br/>
A. Find an image on the screen and click on it <br/>
B. Display a window that will allow users to provide input using most of the standard controls (textbox, dropdownlist, etc.)<br/>
C. Automatically type text on the screen at any location<br/>
D. Get and Put information into the clipboard<br/>
E. Run another application as a process thread. The thread can run asynchronously (the parent application does not wait for completion of the child application) or synchronously (where the parent application does wait for the child). <br/><br/>
