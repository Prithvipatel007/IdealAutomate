# IdealAutomate
Ideal Automate is an open source development platform that allows C# developers to automate any repetitive task and to share what they have automated with other developers.<br/><br/>
The main project is IdealAutomateExplorer.  Ideal Automate Explorer is very similar to Windows Explorer, except Ideal Automate Explorer allows you to have multiple tabs so that you can have several different folders at your fingertips all at once. Here are three ways that you can use Ideal Automate Explorer:<br/><br/>
1. Automate redundant computer tasks<br/>
2. Knowledge Base<br/>
3. ToDo List<br/><br/>

Here is a screenshot of IdealAutomateExplorer:<br/>

<b>Features List</b>

<b>Tags:</b> Windows Explorer with Tabs; ToDo List; Knowledge Base; Automation Scripts; HotKeys; File Comparison; Search; Add Metadata to files; cheat sheets<br/><br/>
<b>1. Windows Explorer Clone</b> - IdealAutomate Explorer is like windows explorer, except it has a lot of additional built-in features. One feature is multiple tabs. Multiple tabs allows you to easily switch between views of multiple folders without having to open multiple versions of windows explorer.<br/><br/>
<b>2. File/New Project</b> -  IdealAutomate Explorer has a File/New Project menu tool item. Use File/New Project to easily create a C# WPF Application with a reference to IdealAutomateCore library. The IdealAutomateCore library allows one to automate almost any task. It does this by making it possible for you to write applications that can find images on the screen. By finding an image on the screen, you are able to locate where you want to read or write something, regardless of which application the image resides within. The fact that you can read and write to virtually any location makes it possible to create a degree of artificial intelligence where the application is able to perform real-time, problem-solving activities. For example, the application can read a piece of information, interpret what it has read, and then make decisions in real time about what to do based on that interpretation.<br/><br/>
<b>3. List and Details View</b> -  IdealAutomate Explorer has a List View and a Details View. Use Details View to preview contents of files when you select them.<br/><br/>
<b>4. Categories and Subcategories</b> -  IdealAutomate Explorer has File/New/Category and File/New/Subcategory menu item. Add Categories and Subcategories to your folder structures to help organize your files better. Categories and Subcategories expand and collapse, and their expanded or collapsed state is remembered. This makes it where you do not have to repeatedly open and close certain folders to get to the level of detail you desire. Categories and Subcategories make it easy to create a knowledge base out of folders and files.<br/><br/>
<b>5. Fast Search</b> -  Search allows you to find all instances of string or regular expression in text, word, or open office files included within all of the subfolders of a parent folder. You can use a hotkey to navigate to the particular line in the result in a file or to open a new tab in IdealAutomate Explorer that points to the immediate parent folder of the file that contains the text that was found.<br/><br/>
<b>6. Build with msbuild</b> -  If you select a folder, you can use the "Build" context menu item to build the solution with msbuild in the background without navigating down to the solution file.<br/><br/>
<b>7. Open solution with Visual Studio</b> -  If you select a folder, you can use "Open With Visual Studio" context menu item to open the solution with Visual Studio without navigating down to the solution file. <br/><br/>
<b>8. Run executable within folder</b> -  If you select a folder, you can use "Run" context menu item to run an executable in the folder or subfolder without navigating down to the executable file. <br/><br/>
<b>9. Open Windows Explorer for folder</b> -  If you select a folder, you can use the "Open With Windows Explorer" context menu item to open the folder with Windows Explorer. <br/><br/>
<b>10.Compare Files</b> -  If you select a file, you can use the "Compare" context menu item to open file in Notepad++ as Actual.txt file or Ideal.txt file for comparing two files.<br/><br/>
<b>11. Add metadata and hotkeys to files</b> -  If you select a file or folder, you can add metadata for: Manual Execution Time, a Custom field, Status, or a HotKey. Manual Execution Time is used to enter how long in seconds that it takes you to do some process manually. Manual Execution Time is compared to Actual Execution Time when you have executables that automate some process to tell you how much time is saved by using the automated process. The Custom Field and Status metadata are particularly useful when you have a folder of files that represent a todo list. Hotkeys make it so that you can execute any program by pressing the hotkey for that program while IdealAutomate Explorer is running.<br/><br/>
