# IdealAutomate
Here is a group of C# WPF applications for automating redundant tasks.
The main project is IdealAutomateExplorer. This project is very similar to Windows Explorer. IdealAutomateExplorer allows
you to create a central repository of all the projects that you have written to automate various redundant tasks that you perform. 
You can use IdealAutomateCore library to help you write projects that automate these tasks. <br/><br/>

You can also use IdealAutomateExplorer to help you build a knowledge base.<br/><br/>
Here is a screenshot of Ideal Automate Explorer:<br/>

IdealAutomateCore is a class library that contains most of the methods that are commonly used to automate any task on the computer. For example, there are methods that allow you to easily do the following things: <br/><br/>
A. Find an image on the screen and click on it <br/>
B. Display a window that will allow users to provide input using most of the standard controls (textbox, dropdownlist, etc.)<br/>
C. Automatically type text on the screen at any location<br/>
D. Get and Put information into the clipboard<br/>
E. Run another application as a process thread. The thread can run asynchronously (the parent application does not wait for completion of the child application) or synchronously (where the parent application does wait for the child). <br/><br/>
