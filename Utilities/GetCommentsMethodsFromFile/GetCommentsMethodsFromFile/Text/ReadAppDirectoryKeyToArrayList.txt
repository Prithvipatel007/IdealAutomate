 ReadAppDirectoryKeyToArrayList takes a key and adds .txt to it in order to create
 a file name. It gets the app data path and adds \IdealAutomate\yourscriptname
 to it. By combining that path to the file name created from the key,
 it can retrieve an arraylist that is unique to your script application.
 The AppDirectory allows you to store personal settings and
 information that you want to keep private (like passwords) in a location
 outside of your script on in the application directory
