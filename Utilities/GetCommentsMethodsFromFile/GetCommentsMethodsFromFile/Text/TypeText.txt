 TypeText - The visual basic SendKeys function is used to mimic 
 pressing special keys (like the enter or alt keys). This means you 
 need to use the Shortcut Keys help file in the IdealAutomate application 
 or google in order to learn what characters can be used to represent
 special keys. For example, the ^ character is used to represent the 
 control key and here is how you indicate the enter key is pressed: 
 {ENTER}. You will also need to learn how to "escape" special characters
 (like the bracket character). If you are trying to type a lot of special
 characters, it may be easier to create a string primitive with the 
 text you want to type and use the PutEntityInClipboard verb to copy 
 the string into the clipboard. After the string is in the clipboard,
 you can use the TypeText verb with control v to paste what is in the
 clipboard to where you want it.
