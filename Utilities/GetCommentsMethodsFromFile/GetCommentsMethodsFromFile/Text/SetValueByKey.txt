 SetValueByKey takes a key and adds .txt to it in order to create
 a file name. It gets the app data path and adds \IdealAutomate\yourscriptname
 to it. By combining that path to the file name,
 it can write a value to the key that is unique to your script application.
 The AppDirectory allows you to store personal settings and
 information that you want to keep private (like passwords) in a location
 outside of your script on in the application directory
